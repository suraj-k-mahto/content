My current [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info) version ships with phpMyAdmin version 3.3.9.2. But there is already a higher version available, version 3.4.10.1. Upgrading the shipped phpMyAdmin to the latest version appears to be very easy. Just downloading and extracting it to the correct folder.

At first, download the latest available version from phpMyAdmin's [download page](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php).
If you have MAMP, extract the files to the following directory (backup the old files first just in case): `/Applications/MAMP/bin/phpMyAdmin`.
If you restart MAMP and go to `http://localhost/phpMyAdmin`, you'll see that your phpMyAdmin interface is upgraded.

For everybody who has MAMP Pro, the correct location of your phpMyAdmin files is `/Library/Application Support/appsolute/MAMP PRO/phpMyAdmin`.
